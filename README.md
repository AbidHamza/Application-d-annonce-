# Application-annonce-Project
Challenge :

This project consists of building a web application that manages classified ads.
A classified ad is characterized by:
- a title
- a description, i.e. the text of the ad
- a category (real estate, clothing, otters, etc.)
- the seller's name or nickname
- a price
- a photo
- the meeting point to collect the object (with GPS coordinates)
- an addition date
(the structure of the database will be given to you below)
The application will list existing ads and search among them, enter
new ads, remove existing ads.
The data will be stored in an SQLite database.
Removing advertisements will require authentication (login, password).
The application should have a pleasant style and ergonomics, and be dynamic.
The exchanges will be carried out through Webservices, using the JSON format.
The application must be viewable on a mobile device (design suitable for small screens).
